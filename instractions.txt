The Task:

For this task you will need to use a local webserver, we recommend you installing xampp,
you can use one that you are familiar with but it should be an apache server as these are the one we use at Tabletop.
If you need any help installing xampp feel free to contact me.

Read and display products data from file products.json , with ability of sorting.

For each product you should nicely and clearly display the following:
 - products name,
 - products price
 - products image.

Each displayed product should be the same size, with image size adapted to the container size.

There should be a ‘Sort by’ functionality, you should be able to sort by:
price (high to low, low to high),
name (ASC),
order (ASC),
also filter by 4 allergens,
for example only show Gluten Free products.

Allergen information can be read from file allergens.json,
Products like to allergens by ‘allergens’ attribute which corresponds to allergen ID

 Allergen Object Example:
  {
    "name" : "Gluten Free",
    "id" : 4,
  }

Product Object example:
  {
    "name": "Tea",
    "order": 1,
    "allergens": "2,3",
    "price": "1.29",
    "image_path": "/images/tea.jpg"
  }


All code should be written in VanillaJS, you can only use ecmascript 5 and below features.
